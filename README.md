#### Problem Statement/ Business Objective
As an analyst for a real estate company, build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset. Senior management also wants to explore the characteristics of the houses using some business intelligence tools. One of those parameters includes understanding which factors are responsible for higher property value - $650K and above.


Given the dataset of Properties (houses) that were sold between 2014 and 2015 in King County, Washington in the US. This data set has over 20k properties which have 19 unique features to describe them. This project seeks to present a Machine Learning model using Regression Algorithm.


#### Steps in Analytic Approach
* Data importation and exploration
* Data wrangling and cleaning
* Build the model
* Improve model by data extraction and feature engineering
* Analyze model result

#### Specific Interest
* Price of houses above 650k


In this project I worked with MySQL and Tableau to understand the data set before proceeding to Python in building the model.
